        <p>Extension of propositional logic that enables reasoning with hypotheses, i.e. the propositions whose truth or falsity is uncertain. Instead of frequency or propensity of some phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation, representing a state of knowledge (objectivist justified by Cox’s Theorem), or as quantification of a personal belief (subjectivist justified by requirements of rationality and coherence following the Dutch book argument or decision theory and de Finetti’s Theorem).</p>
