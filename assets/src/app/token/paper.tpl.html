        <!-- ethos: the why-->
        <p>When one consumes content valuable attention exchanges occur.</p>
        <p>Utilizing the Bidio dapp, advertisers place buy-orders for dimensions of viewer actions. This preserves integrity of the digital media ecosystem. We believe truly native advertising matches the purpose of intentionally sponsored creators.</p>
        <p>If a creator accepts a bid, the sponsor will get any tokens minted when the audience chooses to engage.</p>
        <p>Though the open-source bidding mechanism tokenized viewer actions becomes market liquid.</p>

        <p>cre8coin’s network creates an intelligently designed system: one viewToken minted per second of watch time.</p>
        <p>ERC88, a new token standard, enables us to design a unique set of mechanisms by which multidimensional viewTokens are distributed to maximize general utility.</p>

        <div class="spacing-25"></div>

        <!-- alligning of value; these value exchanges are implicit; we are making it explicit-->
        <p>The attentionToken protocol empowers any genuine storyteller to monetize the intrinsic value of their original content by selling derivative crypto value created when viewers pay attention.</p>

        Vickrey-Clarke Groves mechanisms are highly susceptible to collusion. They allow bad actors to add arbitrary terms to the payout that individual participants can’t influence without changing the underlying incentives.
        For years in the ad-tech industry, waterfall auction dynamics have provided unfair advantages to advertisers and their media buying agencies. However, publishers recently gained the power to sell ‘programmatic guaranteed’ inventory. Bidio’s direct bidding mechanism enables brands to buy exclusive rights to specific tokens, which are continuously minted as viewers pay attention.
        Bidio’s continuous auction mechanism runs without any input from the creator, and it proposes outcomes that would maximize utility of sponsors. Utilizing the multidimensional viewToken protocol, creators know which brands are willing to pay and how much per token.
        Complete Transparency and Control
        At any given time, individual creators have the choice to approve a number of sponsor(s) per video. Since the creator has no way of affecting who will pay the most, she is effectively trying to maximize the sum of her and her viewers’ utility.
         
        For every individual, we run the mechanism without her and choose the outcome that maximizes the utility of all other players given their reported types. Then we include the individual and run the mechanism again. The latter is the outcome chosen. Each player pays (or collects) the difference between the sum of utilities for the other players in the two cases. Effectively, this payment is equivalent to the individual’s social cost or benefit. Since the individual has no way of affecting the sum of utilities that occurs without her, she is effectively trying to maximize the sum of her own and everyone else’s utility. But this is exactly the same as maximizing total social utility!
        Aligning everyone’s incentives not only ensures incentive-compatibility, but also guarantees efficiency. It is easy to find ex-post individually rational and weakly budget balanced versions of this mechanism with some pretty mild additional assumptions. We can also add arbitrary terms to the payout that the individual can’t influence (such as giving each individual some constant amount regardless of the outcome), without changing the underlying incentives. 
        Which sponsor aligns with the creative purpose?!

        Step 2: Allocation Rule ~ deciding who is the winner as a function of the available bids

        There is a unique payment rule P such that (x, p) is DSIC
        P is given by an explicit formula
        If (x, p) is DSIC, what does P have to look like?
        Fix i, b-i , write x(z), p(z) for xi (z, b-i) & pi (z, b-i)
        Piecewise Constant Allocation Rules

        Swapping trick:
        If (x, p) is DSIC, then 0 < z < y
        “Payment Difference Sandwich”
        z(x(y) - x(z)) < p(y) - p(z) < y(x(y) - x(z))
        Implies that if x is not monotone, then x is not implementable
        Revenue-Maximizing Auctions
        With one bidder, “take it or leave it”
        Expected revenue of posted price r = r * (1 - F(r))
        F is the distribution (probability that v is at least r)
        Any single parameter environment with any distribution, characterize the ‘optimal auction’
        Regular (means virtual value function = strictly increasing) vs. irregular
        Figure out the auction which maximizes expected revenue with respect to distributions F1-N
        revelation principle ~ you give me any auction with guaranteed dominant strategies, there is an equivalent auction in terms of revenue, so that truth-telling is a dominant strategy.
        b = v
        allocation rule(s): monotone and bounded
        Payment rule(s):


        Someone doesn’t always win… Creators will often set reserve prices, or simply choose to promote their own brand.
        Virtual value: in auction theory, particularly Bayesian-optimal mechanism design, a virtual valuation of an agent is a function that measures the surplus that can be extracted from that agent. Typical application is a seller who wants to sell an item to a potential buyer and wants to decide on the optimal price. Independently and identically distributed bidders
        General (Multi-Parameter) Mechanism Design
        N bidders
        Finite set of outcomes
        i has private valuation vi for each set of outcomes
        VCG Mechanism
        Theorem: in every environment, there is a DSIC surplus-maximizing mechanism
        Problem with polynomial time
        Why not?
        Elicitation
        2m private parameters per bidder
        Gathering data is not feasible

        Creating Decentralized Governance
        Gibbard (1973) and Satterthwaite (1975) give an impossibility result similar in spirit to Arrow's impossibility theorem. For a very general class of games, only "dictatorial" social choice functions can be implemented.
        A social choice function f () is dictatorial if one agent always receives his most-favored goods allocation, for f (𝜭), ∃i ϵI ui(x, 𝜭i) > ui(x’, 𝜭i) ∀x’ ϵ X
        The theorem states that under general conditions any truthfully implementable social choice function must be dictatorial,
        X is finite and contains at least three elements
        Preferences are rational
        f (𝜭) = X
        It states that for every voting rule, one of the following three things must hold:
        The rule is dictatorial
        The rule limits the possible outcomes to two alternatives only; or
        The rule is susceptible to tactical voting: in certain conditions some voter's sincere ballot may not defend their opinion best.
        Benchmark Model (vs. Game-Theoretic)
        All of the bidders are risk-neutral.
        Each bidder has a private valuation for the item independently drawn from some probability distribution.
        The bidders possess symmetric information.
        The payment is represented as a function of only the bids.
        Private vs. Common Value
        Revenue Equivalence ~ concept in auction theory that states that given certain conditions, any mechanism that results in the same outcomes (i.e. allocates items to the same bidders) also has the same expected revenue ( max bj ).
        Simple Auctions:
        The Price of Anarchy and Equilibrium Welfare Guarantees
        Communication Complexity and Impossibility Results
        Complexity Theory and Algorithmic Game Theory: Some New Connections
        Complexity governs the answer to these basic economic questions:
        Why Prices Need Algorithms:
            Walrasian Equilibria ~ indivisible goods
        Every bidder gets favorite bundle
        The market should clear
        V is the set of all monotone, sub-modular functions OR single-minded “and” bidders
        Suppose that, for a class V of valuations, “welfare maximization” doesn’t reduce to “utility maximization” (polynomial Turing reductions), there are markets with valuations in V without Walrasian equilibria. This forges a link between a purely economic question and complexity theory as we know it.
        Welfare-maximization should be no harder than utility-maximization.
        Barriers to Near-Optimal Equilibria: “The Borders of Border’s Theorem”
        specifying the model of user utilities and deriving clear design objectives; maximizing the amount to be redistributed can become a non-trivial component of their utility
        sponsor strategy ~ adding extrinsic value through bidding (staking)
