        <p>Energy is the imaginary now.</p>
        <p>It is in the moment, in this quantifiable property of the imagined observer, energy flows and is transformed.</p>

        <!--<p>This moment is energy. This moment is valuable.</p>-->
        <p>Imagination is energy. Imagination is valuable.</p>
        <p>In defining a crypto ecosystem, we are able to</p>
        <ul>
            <li>quantify valuable dimensional attention</li>
            <li>create crypto-asset streams as a public ledger of our attention.</li>
            <li>create direct attention markets and exchange potential</li>

        <p>CRE8coin and the attentionToken protocol introduce utlility and distributed governance though the value of choice in how you spend your attention(Token).</p>

        <p>valuable attention exchanges, and a thriving dapp ecosystem is emergent</p>
        <p>the protocol creates valuable attention exchanges.</p>
        <p>a protocol for programmatic, valuable attention exchanges</p>

        <div class="spacing-25"></div>

        <!-- ethos: the why-->
        <p>When one consumes content valuable attention exchanges occur.</p>
        <p>Utilizing the Bidio dapp, advertisers place buy-orders for dimensions of viewer actions. This preserves integrity of the digital media ecosystem. We believe truly native advertising matches the purpose of intentionally sponsored creators.</p>
        <p>If a creator accepts a bid, the sponsor will get any tokens minted when the audience chooses to engage.</p>
        <p>Though the open-source bidding mechanism tokenized viewer actions becomes market liquid.</p>


        <div class="spacing-25"></div>

        <!-- introduce technecalities - programatic problems to solve, ERC-88 standard, link in gist etc. -->
        <p>cre8coin’s network creates an intelligently designed system: one viewToken minted per second of watch time.</p>
        <p>ERC88, a new token standard, enables us to design a unique set of mechanisms by which multidimensional viewTokens are distributed to maximize general utility.</p>

        <div class="spacing-25"></div>



        <!--what are the consequences of a qauntized attention based crypto ecosystem -->
        <p>This cryptosystem optimizes for desired outcomes though rewarding creativity and purposeful sponsorship/investment.</p>
        <!--In auctions one looks for rational mechanisms that maximize projected and realized utility. There is an equitable distribution of value based on attention-generated, token-curated awards.</p>-->


        <!-- alligning of value; these value exchanges are implicit; we are making it explicit-->
        <p>The attentionToken protocol empowers any genuine storyteller to monetize the intrinsic value of their original content by selling derivative crypto value created when viewers pay attention.</p>
        <p>This implicit value exchange is ongoing, and when quantized becomes explicit - on the ledger.</p>

        <!-- important section -->
        <!-- expaning on the idea of a crypto unility and the overall goals-->
        <p>Ultimately, our team is developing a self-sustaining public utility for direct attention exchanges. Our mission is to incentivize universal support of creativity to drive progress throughout digital media networks and society generally.</p>

Instead of frequency or propensity of some phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation, representing a state of knowledge (objectivist justified by Cox’s Theorem), or as quantification of a personal belief (subjectivist justified by requirements of rationality and coherence following the Dutch book argument or decision theory and de Finetti’s Theorem).

        <div class="spacing-10"></div>


        <p>Our central task is to specify a mechanism that incentivizes rational agents to behave in a mannor, based on their private information, that lead to socially desired outcomes.</p>
        <p>Implementation Theory ~ in equilibrium, the mapping from types to outcomes is the same as the mapping that would be chosen by the social choice function. Such intentional structure is required in dominant strategies or Bayes-Nash equilibrium.</p>
        <p>adding a mechanism turns a Bayesian setting into “game form”</p>
        <p>Mechanism: a pair of strategy spaces and a function which maps any strategy to resulting social decisions and transfers.</p>
        <div class="spacing-10"></div>

        <p>AttentionTokens are continuously minted based on viewer actions.</p>
        <p>Desired Outcomes: Creators will produce high-quality content, which drives progress with energy and information. Bidders will reward creators who add extrinsic value to unified groups coordinating around shared goal(s). Viewers will be more accountable for what they watch because they want their own attention to be more valuable. Overall, cre8coin optimizes for individual belief systems by gamifying the discovery of qualitative schelling points. For Bidio participants, utility means fulfillment of purpose with guaranteed authenticity.</p>
        <div class="spacing-10"></div>

        <p>Individuals’ utilities are a function of their type, and the output of their decisions.</p>
        <p>Designers control the choices of their mechanisms, but not the players or their types.</p>

        <p>Compatibility between the bonded nodes’ incentives and protocol security guarantees -- contract based minting of ERC88</p>
        <p>Individual Rationality</p>
        <p>weak budget balance (also referred to as feasibility) requires that the mechanism not pay out more than it receives</p>
        <p>Vickrey-Clarke Groves mechanisms are highly susceptible to collusion. They allow bad actors to add arbitrary terms to the payout that individual participants can’t influence without changing the underlying incentives.</p>
        <div class="spacing-10"></div>

        <!--AD TECH PROB-->
        <p>For years in the ad-tech industry, waterfall auction dynamics have provided unfair advantages to advertisers and their media buying agencies. However, publishers recently gained the power to sell ‘programmatic guaranteed’ inventory.</p> 
        <p>Bidio’s direct bidding mechanism enables brands to buy exclusive rights to specific tokens, which are continuously minted as viewers pay attention.</p>

        <p>Bidio’s continuous auction mechanism runs without any input from the creator, and it proposes outcomes that would maximize utility of sponsors. Utilizing the multidimensional viewToken protocol, creators know which brands are willing to pay and how much per token.</p>
        <div class="spacing-10"></div>

        <p>Complete Transparency and Control</p>
        <p>At any given time, individual creators have the choice to approve a number of sponsor(s) per video. Since the creator has no way of affecting who will pay the most, she is effectively trying to maximize the sum of her and her viewers’ utility.</p>

This powerful cryptosystem mints fractalized networks of multidimensional viewTokens. Soon, Bidio and cre8coin will release the official roadmap.

        Anyone can register and purchase cre8coin with Stripe. Our existing platform stores value in wallets attached to each user’s account - you can see an example on this profile. Soon, Bidio will announce the pre-sale of cre8coin to develop a truly decentralized YouTube for the sake of creativity. Art, journalism, entertainment and general viewership must evolve with support from the digital advertising industry. Let’s create valuable communities around quality content.

        Never stop creating! Sign up to start earning viewToken and cre8coin today.

        Myerson–Satterthwaite Theorem ~ important result in mechanism design and the economics of asymmetric information, which says there is no efficient way for two parties to trade a good when they each have secret, probabilistically different valuations for it, without the risk of forcing one party to trade at a loss.
