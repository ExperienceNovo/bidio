    <h3>join the creative revolution</h3>

    <h3>truly native content sponsorship</h3>

    <p>Our unique influencer marketing platform hosts content for creators who want to get support from sponsors without giving up creative control. Unlike other digital media networks and exchanges, we only take 8% of our usersâ€™ hard-earned advertising revenue.</p>

	<p>Establish your maximum budget, CPC and creative parameters, then let our users produce videos for your consideration. If you choose to sponsor any entries, the original creator will receive incremental payments each time an audience member clicks through to your landing page.</p>
