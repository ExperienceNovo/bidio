          How do you monetize your videos?
          <br><br>
          At this point, it's common knowledge that both YouTube and Facebook take huge percentages of advertising revenue. We only take 8% of ad revenue. BIDIO doesn't believe providing a platform for creation warrants such astronomical fees. Get paid based on your traffic.
          <br><br>
          It's as simple as that.

          Bidio protects authenticity, while helping creators monetize their content. Using our platform, brands can’t tell you what to make. We’re gamifying the discovery of viral videos by facilitating competition for sponsorship rights. Top bidders earn logo placement on endcards, which link to campaign landing pages.
