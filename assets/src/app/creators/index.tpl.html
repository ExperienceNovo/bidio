          Using Bidio, sponsors pay creators like you based on verified results. Our unique "prize-per-click" system helps brands design engaging campaigns, for which users submit content. These truly native advertisers have given up the notion of mind control. Modern digital marketers rely on the crowd to generate positive influence for products and services.

          How do you monetize your videos? YouTube’s audience offers significant value to advertisers, but Google takes 45 percent of revenue. Facebook takes 30 percent from verified pages using Instant Articles, and they allow certain publishers to keep 100 percent of direct sales. However, they refuse to compensate regular users for their content. 
          <br><br>
          Bidio only asks for 8 percent of your hard-earned sponsorship revenue. We just want to help you get paid!

          Bidio protects authenticity, while helping creators monetize their content. Using our platform, brands can’t tell you what to make. We’re gamifying the discovery of viral videos by facilitating competition for sponsorship rights. Top bidders earn logo placement on endcards, which link to campaign landing pages.
