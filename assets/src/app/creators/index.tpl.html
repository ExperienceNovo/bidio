          <br>
          <br>
          Using our unique pay-per-click model, brands confidently invest in user-generated content marketing. Steer away from traditional hit-or-miss techniques of closed-door focus groups and out-of-touch marketing departments seeking the engagement of emerging generations. Handing creative control to the same people your brand is trying to reach will usher in a new era of digital marketing.

          At this point, it's common knowledge that both YouTube and Facebook take upwards of 45% of advertising revenue. We only take 8% of ad revenue. BIDIO doesn't believe providing a platform for creation warrants such astronomical fees.
          <br>
          <br>
          It's as simple as that.

          Ad-blocking technology was created in defense of increasingly obtrusive, annoying, and numerous marketing efforts by brands trying to enter the age of the internet.
          <br>
          <br>
          Here, that problem is solved. Brands establish campaigns for advertising new products or services, with BIDIO members leading the charge. Establish your maximum budget, cost-per-click, and expectations, then let our members produce videos for your consideration. If you choose to sponsor any entries, the original creator will receive incremental payments when unique viewers click-through to your chosen advertisement.
          <br>
          <br>
          BIDIO's payment system is structured to guarantee maximum ROI. There are no service costs. You only pay when viewers see what you're paying for them to see.

          The internet has irreversibly changed the entire media industry, the most profound being the nearly non-existent barrier to sharing content.
          <br>
          <br>
          However, certain platforms have taken advantage of the massive influx of content creators by squeezing as much money from them as possible. Naturally, creators are seeking alternatives. 
          <br>
          <br>
          BIDIO is that alternative. Join the future with us.
