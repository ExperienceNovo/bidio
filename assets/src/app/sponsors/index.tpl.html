          Using Bidio’s “prize-per-click” system, brands cost-effectively inspire and leverage user-generated content. Why only ask a few agencies to produce branded videos, when you could ask the world wide web? Simply request funny/cool videos, or upload a full creative brief. Our users will submit engaging productions, and you only have to pay them for verified results. Approved submissions will appear on your branded channel, and we have enabled automatic disclosure.

          People despise pre-roll and mid-roll ads, so why pay to force impressions? YouTube wants to be television on the internet, but since there are infinite channels, viewers are less tolerant of interruptions. Facebook disguises ads (a.k.a. boosted posts) by placing them in a dynamic newsfeed, but their algorithms shouldn’t control what people see. As an alternative, Bidio refuses to interrupt viewers, while protecting authenticity, consumer choice and privacy.

          Ad blockers help prevent third parties from serving content that interrupts viewers. However, Bidio isn’t affected by these firewalls because our system never calls ad servers. Sponsors simply upload their logo and indicate the URL of each campaign landing page. Establish your maximum budget, cost-per-click, and expectations, then let our members produce videos for your consideration. If you choose to sponsor any entries, the original creator will receive incremental payments when unique viewers click-through.

          Successful influencer marketing relies on trust, but creators work on both sides of the digital media industry. The lucky ones produce content for publishers, but others work for advertisers. Some attempt to self-publish, although it’s difficult to make money that way. Certain platforms have taken advantage of all the noise by squeezing out as much money as possible. Naturally, creators are seeking alternatives.
          <br>
          <br>
          BIDIO is that alternative.
