          People despise pre-roll and mid-roll ads, so why pay to force impressions? YouTube wants to be television on the internet, but since there are infinite channels, viewers are less tolerant of interruptions. Facebook disguises ads (a.k.a. boosted posts) by placing them in a dynamic newsfeed, but their algorithms shouldn’t control what people see. As an alternative, Bidio refuses to interrupt viewers, while protecting authenticity, consumer choice and privacy.

          Start your campaign by setting a budget, call to action, landing page and cost per click. If sponsors are bidding on a video, the original creator will receive incremental payments when unique viewers click through.

          <!--Ad blockers help prevent third parties from serving content that interrupts viewers. However, Bidio isn’t affected by these firewalls because our system never calls ad servers. Sponsors simply upload their logo and indicate the URL of each campaign landing page. Establish your maximum budget, cost-per-click, and expectations, then let our members produce videos for your consideration. If you choose to sponsor any entries, the original creator will receive incremental payments when unique viewers click-through.-->

          Most people hate, so why pay to force impressions? Bidio refuses to interrupt viewers, while protecting their privacy. Our sponsors only pay for unique click-throughs (guaranteed ROI), so they can take risks on authentic productions.

          Successful influencer marketing relies on trust, but creators work on both sides of the digital media industry. The lucky ones produce content for publishers, but others work for advertisers. Some attempt to self-publish, although it’s difficult to make money that way. Certain platforms have taken advantage of all the noise by squeezing out as much money as possible. Naturally, creators are seeking alternatives.
          <br>
          <br>
          BIDIO is that alternative.

          Influencer marketing helps advertisers borrow trust from genuine creators. However, paid testimonials are usually ineffective. Why not gain recognition through sponsored authenticity?
