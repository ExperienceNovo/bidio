I debated for months about how to use it - do I record one song with my band at ECU, The Philharmonic? Do I film another big production music video with Brian DeContrerras? At a studio as sophisticated as Manifold, the possibilities were endles. After a big discussion about my musical directions with Ian Schreier, the album's producer, I decided to attempt to record an entire EP in one day.\n\nAfter many late night pep talks, practices, and meditation sessions, I walked into Manifold ready to make a simple, stripped down record that would focus on my songwriting. It was a long day, but we drove home with the knowledge that we'd made a record to be proud of. \n\nSo now that Bones is mixed, mastered, and ripe for listening on Soundcloud, we're crossing a bridge that needs more funding. So far, we've enjoyed a great response from everyone. We couldn't be more excited to raise this money and get this record out there.\"","amazonUrl":"https://bidio8.s3.amazonaws.com/47347239-d815-4612-94ee-83d75fed0196.mp4","urlTitle":"bones---matt-phillips","user":{"$oid":"57e12842f281560300776267"},"minimumPrice":"1","viewCount":43,"clickCount":2,"createdAt":{"$date":"2016-09-20T20:28:34.509Z"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://bidio8.s3.amazonaws.com/e78ee743-77d1-4886-96d1-e3934e0a7579.png","updatedAt":{"$date":"2018-06-14T20:53:48.281Z"},"liveViewCount":1}
